# Optical-Character-Recognition-OCR-
A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is created for OCR application using ‘GUIDE’ keyword in MATLAB command line. 
This application is used for recognising characters in a word-containing grayscale image. 
It does so by taking an input image by browsing through the training dataset collected manually from the subset of Erik's Neural Network.

The goal of this project is to classify images using the Neural Network. This network is a hidden layer network with 600 nodes. The input matrix is a representation of pixels of 25 x 25 image, containing 625 elements. The output of the network is a matrix in which every row has 62 elements having value 1 of only one element and 0 for rest, representing the chosen class [A-Z a-z 0-9]. 
Start editing the code from OCR.m file.
